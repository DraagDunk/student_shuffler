# Student shuffler

This app is meant to help teachers shuffle the students in their classes into groups of a predetermined size or number. The app can take a .json file of a certain format, and import each student from that file into its internal logic. Lists of students created by the software can be saved to a .json file format, and lists of groups created by the software can be saved to a human-readable .txt-file format.
