# Student shuffler

This app is meant to help teachers shuffle the students in their classes into groups of a predetermined size or number. The app can take a .txt file of a certain format, and import each student from that list into its internal logic. Lists of students and lists of the groups created by the software can both be saved to a .txt file format.

## Install

Install the latest version in executable form [here](https://github.com/DraagDunk/student_shuffler/releases/latest).

You only need the executable for your operating system.

Currently, your virus detection software will probably react pretty severely to this software. This will be fixed as soon as I figure out how.
