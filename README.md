# Student shuffler

This app is meant to help teachers shuffle the students in their classes into groups of a predetermined size or number. The app can take a .txt file of a certain format, and import each student from that list into its internal logic. Lists of students and lists of the groups created by the software can both be saved to a .txt file format.
